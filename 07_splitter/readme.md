# **Splitter in LangChain:**

In LangChain, **Splitters** are tools that break down large documents or blocks of text into smaller, manageable chunks. These chunks are easier for language models to process, as most language models have a limit on the number of tokens (words or characters) they can handle at once. Splitters ensure that long documents can be fed into models in parts while preserving the structure of information.

## **Why We Use Splitters?**

Splitters are essential when dealing with large or unstructured documents that exceed a language model's token limit. By splitting text into smaller chunks, Splitters make it possible to process, analyze, and retrieve information without losing important content or exceeding input size constraints. Splitters help in creating chunked data that can be indexed and queried, making retrieval more efficient and relevant.

## **Benefits of Splitters**

1. **Improved Model Compatibility**: Allows long documents to be processed by language models with token limits.
2. **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Smaller chunks improve retrieval accuracy and speed.
3. **Optimized Memory Use**: Reduces memory load by breaking down large documents into smaller, more manageable parts.
4. **Better Context Management**: Enables models to handle specific sections or topics in detail rather than a single lengthy document.

## **Types of Splitters**

### **1. Character Splitters**

- **CharacterTextSplitter**: Splits text based on a character limit per chunk. Ideal for content that can be split easily without disrupting meaning, like plain text or simple paragraphs.

### **2. Token-Based Splitters**

- **TokenTextSplitter**: Splits text based on token count rather than characters, aligning with the token limit constraints of language models. Useful for maximizing content that fits within a model's input limit.

### **3. Sentence Splitters**

- **SentenceTextSplitter**: Splits text by sentences, preserving sentence-level structure. Useful for documents where maintaining sentence integrity is important, like articles and reports.

### **4. Recursive Splitters**

- **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**: Uses multiple levels of splittingâ€”first by paragraphs, then by sentences, and finally by characters. It maintains logical chunks and only splits into smaller parts if necessary, making it suitable for documents with complex structures.

### **5. Document Structure Splitters**

- **MarkdownSplitter**: Splits Markdown files based on headers or section markers. Useful for documentation or content-heavy files where hierarchy and section boundaries matter.
- **HTMLSplitter**: Extracts and splits HTML documents, keeping sections or tags intact, ideal for webpage or structured HTML-based data.

### **6. Custom Splitters**

- **Custom Splitters**: LangChain allows developers to create custom splitters based on specific requirements, such as splitting by unique delimiters, timestamps in transcripts, or custom paragraph markers.

These Splitters in LangChain help ensure that long documents can be handled effectively, making them valuable in applications like document search, summarization, and content generation.
